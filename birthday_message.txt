Sara,

I don't know why I am doing this. I feel like I am being so unfair to myself because I will just keep hurting myself. But then I get a moment of calmness and I remember it's your birthday. How can I be upset on the day you were born? For me that's the happiest day in my life - that you came into this world. I couldn't not say happy birthday to the person I loved more than anything in this world. The person who made me realize that the word "love" isn't just a fantasy. The person who lightened up my world and even for a short period of time made me the happiest man alive.

I will not say anything negative. I will keep everything inside. Because even if it's one-sided, I have never stopped believing, nor will I ever stop believing, that you are my true love. Despite how things ended. I know the person I fell in love with. And that's the only truth I will keep with me forever.

I know you might not like this day. But for me, I couldn't be anything but grateful and happy that I met you and fell in love with you. This whole website - I am dedicating it to you. It speaks from my heart how I truly feel.

Sara, wallah, I still remember that day at Mall of Emirates. Sitting in the car parking on the pavement, talking about the peanut butter kid, that awkward first hug. From that moment something inside me just knew. I knew you were different. I knew you were the one. Even when I tried to act cool and call myself Mr. Awesome, deep down I was already falling.

You asked me once why I never gave up on you no matter what. The answer is simple - because there is no one else I'd rather be with. Not then. Not now. Not ever. You are the only person I could spend a whole day with and still want more time. You are the only person whose smile makes everything make sense. You are the only person who truly knows me - the real me - and I truly know you - the real Sara.

I have been your biggest fan since day one. And I will always be your biggest fan and supporter. Even from a distance. Even if you never read this. Even if you hate me. Because my love for you was never conditional. It was never "I love you if you do this" or "I love you when you're this way." It was always just... I love you. Period. Full stop. No conditions.

You once told me I was the only person you could truly rely on. The only one who knew your darkness the way I do. The only one who stayed when everyone else would have left. I don't say this to remind you of what we had. I say this because it's still true. I would still stay. I would still choose you. I would still love you through anything.

I know now that you are literally my biggest strength and weakness. I can't stop loving you - I just love you more and more. I can't stay mad at you. When you are happy, I am probably the happiest man alive. When you are sad, I am probably the saddest man alive. People say don't make a person your source of happiness. But you are all these things to me. Whether you read my messages, ignore them, block me, or whatever - I will still be the same person who fell in love with you.

This birthday, I just want you to know one thing:

My heart belongs to you and you only.

I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you.

I love you Sara. I love you more than life itself wallah. And I have been with you in your darkest moments and your brightest ones. I was never trying to control you or push anything on you. I just cared too much. I still do. I always will.

Happy Birthday to the woman who changed my entire existence.
Happy Birthday to my true love.
Happy Birthday to Sara.

I don't know what the future holds. I don't know if you'll ever come back to me or if we'll ever be together again. But I know one thing for certain - you will always be the love of my life. The one who made me believe in love. The one who made me feel alive.

Thank you for existing.
Thank you for being born.
Thank you for giving me the most beautiful memories of my life.
Thank you for being Sara.

I love you with all my heart.

Forever and always yours,
Weni

P.S. - I am still your biggest fan. Always will be. ❤️
